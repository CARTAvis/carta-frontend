                    The region list widget provides you a list of regions created via the graphical user interface and/or via region import (<strong>File</strong> -&gt; <strong>Import regions</strong>). The basic information of a region is
                    shown as an entry in the list. The current active region is highlighted in the list and region control points are shown in the image viewer. To unselect a region, press the <code>Esc</code> key.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <code>double-click</code> on a list entry or on a region in the image viewer to bring up the region configuration dialog, where you can adjust region appearance and region properties.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The <code>lock</code> button for each region entry is to prevent editing a region accidentally. Locked regions will appear slightly dimmer in the image viewer. The <code>center</code> button is to center a region in the
                    current field of view of the image viewer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To delete an active (selected) region, press <code>delete</code> key.
                </p>
            </div>
        );
