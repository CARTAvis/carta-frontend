        <p>This dialog allows you to confirm the Stokes parameters deduced automatically for the selected images, and make corrections if it is necessary.</p>
        <p>
            The automatic identification attempts to deduce the Stokes values from the image headers. If Stokes information is not available in the headers, the file names are used as a fallback. If automatic identification fails, you will
            have to assign the missing Stokes parameters manually.
