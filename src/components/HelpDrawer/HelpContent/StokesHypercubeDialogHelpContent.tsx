            Within this dialog, you're granted the capability to validate and refine the automatic identification of Stokes parameters sourced from the image list. This process ensures accuracy by allowing necessary adjustments when
            required.

        <p>
            The automatic identification is powered by information derived from the image headers. In cases where Stokes parameter details are absent from the headers, CARTA employs an educated estimation based on file names. However, when
            these mechanisms fall short, the manual assignment of Stokes parameters becomes imperative for precision.
