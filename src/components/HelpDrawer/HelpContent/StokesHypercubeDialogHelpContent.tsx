            This dialog allows user to confirm the auto-identification of the Stokes parameters from the image list and make corrections when necessary. The auto-identification obtains information from the image headers. If Stokes
            information is not available in the headers, CARTA will make a guess from the file names. Otherwise, you need to assign the Stokes parameters manually.
