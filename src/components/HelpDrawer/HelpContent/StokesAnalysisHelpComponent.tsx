                <p>The Stokes analysis widget is specifically made for efficient visualization of a Stokes cube. The widget includes plots, such as:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Region spectral profiles for Stokes Q and Stokes U, as absolute or fractional values</li>
                    <li>Polarized intensity spectral profile, as absolute or fractional values</li>
                    <li>Linearly polarized angle spectral profile</li>
                    <li>Stokes Q vs Stokes U scatter plot</li>
                </ul>
                <p>All these plots are inter-linked so that when zooming profiles, data in the visible range will be highlighted in the scatter plot, and vice versa.</p>
                <h3 id="images">Images</h3>
                <p>The image dropdown defaults to &quot;Active&quot; image which means the current image in the image viewer.</p>
                <h3 id="regions">Regions</h3>
                <p>The region dropdown defaults to &quot;Active&quot; region which means a selected region in the image viewer. Users can select a region by clicking one on the image viewer, or by clicking a region entry on the region list
                    widget. Stokes profile plot of the selected region will be updated accordingly. If no region is selected, &quot;Active&quot; region defaults to cursor.</p>
                <h3 id="responsive-and-progressive-profile-update">Responsive and progressive profile update</h3>
                <p>When region Stokes profiles are requested, depending on the performance of the server, users may see profiles are updated piece by piece in regular interval. This feature provides a visual progress update for better user
                    experience. In addition, if users move a region while profiles are being updating, the old calculations will be terminated immediately and calculations of the new region Stokes profiles will start and users will see
                    partial profiles in seconds.</p>
                <h3 id="spectral-conventions-and-reference-frame">Spectral conventions and reference frame</h3>
                <p>With the &quot;Conversion&quot; tab of the Stokes analysis settings dialogue, users can change the spectral convention, including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Radio velocity (km/s, m/s)</li>
                    <li>Optical velocity (km/s, m/s)</li>
                    <li>Frequency (GHz, MHz, kHz, Hz)</li>
                    <li>Wavelength (m, mm, um, Angstrom)</li>
                    <li>Air wavelength (m, mm, um, Angstrom)</li>
                    <li>Channel</li>
                </ul>
                <p>and spectral reference frame, including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>LSRK: the rest-frame of the kinematical local standard of rest</li>
                    <li>LSRD: the rest-frame of the dynamical local standard of rest</li>
                    <li>BARY: barycentric, the rest-frame of the solar-system barycenter</li>
                    <li>TOPO: topocentric, the observer's rest-frame on Earth</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Note that depending on the integrity of image headers, some conversions may not be possible.</p>
                <h3 id="data-smoothing">Data smoothing</h3>
                <p>The displayed profiles and the scatter plot can be smoothed via the &quot;Smoothing&quot; tab of the Stokes analysis settings dialogue (the cog icon). A shortcut button of the &quot;Smoothing&quot; tab can be found at the
                    top-right corner of the widget.</p>
                <h3 id="interactivity-zoom-pan-changing-channel">Interactivity: zoom, pan, changing channel</h3>
                <p>The x and y ranges of the Stokes profile plot can be modified by</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><code>scrolling wheel</code> (up to zoom in and down to zoom out with respect to the cursor position)</li>
                    <li><code>click-and-drag</code> horizontally to zoom in x</li>
                    <li><code>click-and-drag</code> vertically to zoom in y</li>
                    <li><code>click-and-drag</code> diagonally to zoom in both x and y</li>
                    <li><code>double-click</code> to reset x and y ranges</li>
                    <li><code>shift + click-and-drag</code> to pan in x</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Users may click on the Stokes profile plot to switch to a channel (as indicated by a red vertical line) and view the image in the image viewer. The red line is draggable and acts equivalently like the channel slider in
                    the animator widget.</p>
                <h3 id="exports">Exports</h3>
                <p>The Stokes profile plots can be exported as a png file or a text file in tsv format via the buttons at the bottom-right corner (shown when hovering over the plot).</p>
                <h3 id="plot-cosmetics">Plot cosmetics</h3>
                <p>The appearance of the Stokes profile plot is customizable via the &quot;Line Plot Styling&quot; tab of the Stokes analysis settings dialogue (the cog icon). Supported options are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>colors of Stokes Q and Stokes U profiles</li>
                    <li>plot styles including steps (default), lines, and dots</li>
                    <li>line width for steps or lines</li>
                    <li>point size for dots</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In addition, the appearance of the scatter plot can be customized with the &quot;Scatter Plot Styling&quot; tab too, including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Colormap</li>
                    <li>Symbol size</li>
                    <li>Symbol transparency</li>
                    <li>Q-to-U scale ratio as unity</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        );
