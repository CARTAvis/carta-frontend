                    Spatial profiler widget allows you to view a profile from a horizontal cut or a vertical cut at the cursor position in the image viewer. The cursor position may be fixed in the image viewer by pressing <code>F</code>{" "}
                    key. Pressing again will unfreeze the cursor.
                </p>
                <p>The cursor position in the image viewer is displayed as a red vertical line in the spatial profile plot.</p>
                <p>
                    When cursor is in the image viewer, the cursor position and pointed pixel value in image and world coordinates are reported at the bottom-left corner of the spatial profiler widget. When cursor moves into the spatial
                    profile plot, numerical values of the profile at the cursor position (displayed as a grey vertical line) will be reported instead.

                <p>
                    As an option in the <code>Styling</code> tab of the spatial profiler settings dialog, mean and RMS values of the profile can be visualized as a green dashed line and a shaded area in the profile plot. Numerical values
                    are displayed at the bottom-left corner. Note that CARTA includes all data in the current zoom level of the profile plot to perform the calculations. If zoom level changes, mean and RMS values will be updated too.

                    For performance reasons, a profile is min-max decimated before rendering if the number of points of the profile is greater than the screen resolution of the spatial profiler widget. The kernel size of profile decimation
                    is dynamically adjusted so that profile features are mostly preserved. When decimation is applied, the line style of the profile plot is switched to &quot;line&quot;, regardless the setting in the spatial profiler
                    settings dialog. When no decimation is applied (e.g., at higher profile zoom level, or profile has fewer points than the screen resolution), the line style becomes &quot;step&quot; (as default in the <code>Styling</code>{" "}
                    tab of the settings dialog).
