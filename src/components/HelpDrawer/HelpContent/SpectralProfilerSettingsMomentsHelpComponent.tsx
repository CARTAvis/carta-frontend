                <p>
                    Moment images can be generated and viewed with CARTA. The <code>Moments</code> tab provides several control parameters to define how moment images are calculated, including:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Image</b>: the image file for moment calculations. &quot;Active&quot; refers to the image displayed in the image viewer.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Region</b>: a region can be selected so that moment calculations are limited inside the region. &quot;Active&quot; refers to the selected region in the image viewer. If no region is selected, full image is
                        included in the moment calculations.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Coordinate, System, and Range</b>: the spectral range (e.g., velocity range) used for moment calculations is defined with these options. The range can be defined either via the text input fields, or via the cursor
                        by dragging horizontally in the spectral profiler widget.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Mask and Range</b>: these options define a pixel value range used for moment calculations. If mask is &quot;None&quot;, all pixels are included. If mask is &quot;Include&quot; or &quot;Exclude&quot;, the pixel
                        value range defined in the text input fields is included or excluded, respectively. Alternatively, the pixel value range can be defined via the cursor by dragging vertically in the spectral profiler widget.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Moments</b>: which moment images to be calculated are defined here. Supported options are:
                        <ul>
                            <li>-1: Mean value of the spectrum</li>
                            <li>0: Integrated value of the spectrum</li>
                            <li>1: Intensity weighted coordinate</li>
                            <li>2: Intensity weighted dispersion of the coordinate</li>
                            <li>3: Median value of the spectrum</li>
                            <li>4: Median coordinate</li>
                            <li>5: Standard deviation about the mean of the spectrum</li>
                            <li>6: Root mean square of the spectrum</li>
                            <li>7: Absolute mean deviation of the spectrum</li>
                            <li>8: Maximum value of the spectrum</li>
                            <li>9: Coordinate of the maximum value of the spectrum</li>
                            <li>10: Minimum value of the spectrum</li>
                            <li>11: Coordinate of the minimum value of the spectrum</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    When all the parameters are defined, by clicking the <code>Generate</code> button moment calculations will begin. Depending on the file size, moment calculations may take a while. If that happens, you may consider to
                    cancel the calculations and re-define a proper region and/or spectral range.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once moment images are generated, they will be loaded and displayed in the image viewer. They are named as $image_filename.moment.$keyword. For example, if moment 0, 1 and 2 images are generated from the image M51.fits,
                    they will be named as M51.fits.moment.integrated, M51.fits.moment.weighted_coord, and M51.fits.moment.weighted_dispersion_coord, respectively. These images are kept in RAM per session and if there is a new request of
                    moment calculations, these images will be deleted first. Optionally, calculated moment images can be exported in CASA or FITS format via &quot;File&quot; -&gt; &quot;Save image&quot;.
                </p>

                <h4>NOTE</h4>
                <p>Due to a CASA issue, image of &quot;Median coordinate&quot; cannot be generated. The request of &quot;Median coordinate&quot; is ignored automatically.</p>
